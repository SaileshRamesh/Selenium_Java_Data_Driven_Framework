# Selenium_Java_Data_Driven_Framework
Data Driven framework is used to drive test cases and suites from an external data feed. The data feed can be data sheets like xls, xlsx, and csv files.A Data Driven Framework in Selenium is a technique of separating the “data set” from the actual “test case” (code). Since the test case is separated from the data set, one can easily modify the test case of a particular functionality without making changes to the code.
